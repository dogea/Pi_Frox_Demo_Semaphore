# Ansible Collection - Pi Frox Demo

This is an example Ansible Collection demonstrating a simple use case where Servicenow Portal is used to order a new web page. The user selects the destination server on which the web page will be deployed, defines a title and and text. He/she then selects the font color and validate the order. Ansible is then used to deploy an Apache web server on the target server and deploy the web page. The user then, has the possibility to change the content of the web page and/or decommission it alltogether
